#  Retrogressive Thaw Slump Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on the detection of **retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS)** using binary semantic segmentation. A **U-Net** architecture is employed to segment satellite imagery, specifically leveraging **Sentinel-1** (SAR) and **Sentinel-2** (optical) datasets. The project includes data fusion techniques, preprocessing tools, model training, and prediction pipelines.

Permafrost degradation is a critical issue in Arctic environments, and RTS detection is vital for monitoring landscape changes. This project builds a reproducible deep learning pipeline capable of detecting these slumps from multi-source satellite imagery.
